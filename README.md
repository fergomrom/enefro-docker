# Project: Container and cloud deployment of an application

This repo contains the files used on a college project developed by Fernando GÃ³mez for the University of Seville.

During this project a medical web application is deployed using Docker containers, Azure cloud instances and Kubernetes leaving behind the previous model of a monolithic virtual machine. This approach will bring new features and options that would have been impossible using a traditional deployment.

The application code is not available because is not open source.

The project is developed on [this PDF file](https://github.com/ferkaz/enefro-docker/blob/master/Despliegue%20de%20un%20servicio%20web%20en%20una%20plataforma%20cloud%20IaaS%20usando%20contenedores%20-%20PFC%20Fernando%20G%C3%B3mez%20Romero.pdf?raw=true) [SPANISH].
